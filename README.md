# spinnaker-kustomize

This repo contains a base kustomization that can be used to install Spinnaker to
a Kubernetes cluster. Please see the
[RFC](https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/blob/master/rfc/halyard-lite.md)
for an overview of the new Kubernetes-native installation pathway that is under
development.

This repo is under active development and is not ready for production (or even
development) use, but stay tuned for updates!
